Detransitioning Initial Summary

A huge part of my personal experience is as a "detransitioner" - someone who transitioned from the sex that they were assigned at birth to a different identity, whether that involves medical treatment or not.

There's typically two groups of detransitioning individuals, that I consider, though the official definition is not limited to my own opinion. Detransitoiners are people who medically transitioned using a combination or hormones, top surgery, bottom surgery, and other masculinizing / femininizing / "neutralizing" proceedures. There are many forms of gender affirming care, but surgery is often the most extreme example. Desisters, on the other hand, are people who identified as transgender at one point in time, but now feel differently. These people have not medically transitioned, but they may have come out socially, changed their legal name and/or sex, and other major steps that a transgender person might take in their life.

I identify as both detrans and trans. Those are both my experience and my functional labels.

Later I'll add more information about how I came out and what it was like to transition at the age of 15. I'll end up diving into SA, so I'll need to figure out how to navigate triggers.

I will also want to figure out how to divide my professional and personal pages. Separate accounts, I imagine.
