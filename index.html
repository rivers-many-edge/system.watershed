# Here I'm going to attempt to share some of my work which is personal to me.

<p>This place is also going to hopefully lead to future prospects in projecting my voice in my professional and personal lives.
This repository is not *fully* set up, yet. Be patient with me while I work on it!<p>

<p>THANKS! :)<p>

![Nature scenery from my trip to Alaska. It's summertime and the snow is melting off the mountains and draining into the mineral-rich lakes and rivers. The water there is a crystal blue with an ethereal aura. The area is densely packed with different types of wildlife; so much so that bears and other predators are a constant risk. My father was chased down by a moose ad got away, anecdotally. In this image specifically, the lake landscape expands out into a muddy marsh with yellow tall grasses.](/Art General/Photography/Alaskan Scene.png)
