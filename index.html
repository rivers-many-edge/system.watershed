# art-home
# Here I'm going to attempt to share some of my work which is personal to me.

This place is also going to hopefully lead to future prospects in projecting my voice in my professional and personal lives.
This repository is not *fully* set up, yet. Be patient with me while I work on it!

THANKS! :)

![Nature scenery from my trip to Alaska. It's summertime and the snow is melting off the mountains and draining into the mineral-rich lakes and rivers. The water there is a crystal blue with an ethereal aura. The area is densely packed with different types of wildlife; so much so that bears and other predators are a constant risk. My father was chased down by a moose ad got away, anecdotally. In this image specifically, the lake landscape expands out into a muddy marsh with yellow tall grasses.](/Art General/Photography/Alaskan Scene.png)
