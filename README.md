# art-home
# Here I'm going to attempt to share some of my work which is personal to me.

This place is also going to hopefully lead to future prospects in projecting my voice in my professional and personal lives.
This repository is not *fully* set up, yet. Be patient with me while I work on it!

THANKS! :)
